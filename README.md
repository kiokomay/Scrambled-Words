# Scrambled Words

## About the Game

Scrambled Words is a game where the user is given a bunch of letters and the goal is to unscrabmle it and find the correct word with the letters. There have been many variations of word scrambling games, however, my version focuses on achieveing a high score to win the game.

## Getting Started

### Link to the Game

### How the Game Works

When the player clicks the play button they will see the game screen consisting of their level (starting at level 1), their score (starting at 0), the scrambled word, the button to submit their guess and a button to reset the game. As the user works through the scrambled words, they'll notice that their level will increase after they get 10 correct answers. When the level increases, the number of letters to unscramble will go up by 1. The user must complete all 5 levels with a score of at least 250 to win.

## Future Additions

In the future I think it would be cool to add:

-more difficult levels
-leaderboard
-"unscramble the word again" button
-game timer
-limited number of attempts for each game
